# charles-bookmarks-app
Didn't finish. Got stuck a few times after hours and my code broke a few times slowing me down. It's late and this is all I could get to. I'm not sure why the css stopped working when the site went live.

The user stories I completed are:

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

title
url link
description
rating (1-5)

I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

The link to the live site is: https://thinkful-ei-leopard.github.io/charles-bookmarks-app/
